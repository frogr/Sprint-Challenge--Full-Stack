#What is the difference between Node.js and Express.js?
*Node.js is a runtime for javascript. it allows you to write backend and serverside code. Express is a library for Node that provides a lot of useful HTTP utility methods and middlewares to make serverside coding easier.*

#What are the core features of Express.js
*I think the most used (or at least, most useful in our cases) features in express are the express.get, express.post, req, res, and express.listen features. They're all HTTP utilities and they make coding a server easy as cake*

#What is Postman and what is it used for?
*Postman is basically a browser, but with robust request functionalities. Instead of in Chrome where you're constantly making GET requests all over the web, in Postman you're able to customize the type of request you make and provide extra parameters like bodies and headers.*

#What arguments are passed to Custom Middleware functions and what is the third parameter used for?
*I think the answer is req, res, next. Next tells express to use the next middleware.*

#What is MongoDB and what is it used for?
*MongoDB is a nonrelational database. It's used to persist server data, and it uses JavaScript Objects to store all information*

#What is Mongoose.js and what is it used for?
*Mongoose is a library for JavaScript that allows you to query your Mongo database and modify (save, delete, etc) documents*
